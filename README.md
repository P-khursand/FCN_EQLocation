FCN_EQLocation highlights a superior approach for earthquake location compared to traditional methods like Hypo71 and NonLinLoc. By processing raw waveform data directly, FCN_EQLocation eliminates phase-picking and velocity model dependencies. Results show FCN_EQLocation achieves higher accuracy, particularly in depth determination and variable-quality data handling. Key limitations include: reliance on training data quality, reduced performance for linear seismicity trends, and slightly higher horizontal errors. Nevertheless, FCN_EQLocation represents a major advancement in automated, high-precision earthquake localization. Future work should address training biases and improve tectonic pattern interpretation.
